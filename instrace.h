/* Code Manipulation API Sample:
 * instrace_simple.c
 *
 * Collects a dynamic instruction trace and dumps it to a text file.
 * This is a simpler (and slower) version of instrace_x86.c.
 *
 * (1) It fills a per-thread-buffer from inlined instrumentation.
 * (2) It calls a clean call to dump the buffer into a file.
 *
 * The trace is a simple text file with each line containing the PC and
 * the opcode of the instruction.
 *
 * This client is a simple implementation of an instruction tracing tool
 * without instrumentation optimization.  It also uses simple absolute PC
 * values and does not separate them into library offsets.
 * Additionally, dumping as text is much slower than dumping as
 * binary.  See instrace_x86.c for a higher-performance sample.
